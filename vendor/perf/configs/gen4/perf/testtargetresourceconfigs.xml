<!-- This is a target specific resource config file which can be
used to overwrite the node paths mentioned in common resources file
and also to modify the Supported field information. -->

<!-- This file supports only Config tag, which has the following fields
* MajorValue and MinorValue, both are required to uniquely
identify the resource.
* Node, the new node path to overwrite the already existing path
of commonresourceconfigs.xml file.
* Supported, to indicate whether the resource is supported or not.
* For each config tag, either of Node or Supported fields need
to be mentioned.
NOTE - It is not Mandatory to write all the resources which are not supported,
as anyway perflock calls of these resources would fail.

Exception tag is used to pass the exception why ths node cannot be tested.
Cluster tag is used when node in resource xml is cluster specific(put logical cluster here).
Cluster 0=> Big
Cluster 1=> Little
Cluster 2=> Prime

| RVal | Wval | Reason
| Yes  | Yes  | Different Value read and write
| No   | Yes  | Read Val Same as write Value
| Blank| Blank| Unsupported Node

(Yes) => Tag is Added
(No) => Tag is not Added
(Blank) => Tag is added but written value is blank (eg: WVal="").
