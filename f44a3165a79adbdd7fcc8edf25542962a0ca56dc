      "message": "\"just break the boot in bengal\" It doesn\u0027t matter, bengal remains 5.15, if it was another commit that broke the boot in taro or KAILUA this would be reverted, right? bengal is an inferior SoC but remains part of 5.15, It doesn\u0027t make sense to have a \"qcom/common tree\" if that leaves it broken for a platform even though it has an easy solution.besides, you don\u0027t have 5.15, so it\u0027s better to let whoever actually uses that component decide that. Anyway I will check which exact component is causing this problem.",

Just because I don\u0027t have a 5.15 device doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t have a say in changes made on qcom/common. You could always add back 32-bit blobs for the specific component where the breakages come from and guard it from bengal which would make a whole lot of sense than to ship it completely for everything else. That said if taro or kailua had it broken, we\u0027d probably guard it out anyways ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.",

      "message": "nah, bengal being inferior was never the point. bengal being the only minority is the point here. if it breaks boot in taro or waipio, then revert it because it\u0027s breaking boot across platforms. just xiaomi bengal not booting isn\u0027t the right thing to get this reverted. moreover, if for your device if you can just add it to your device tree, it wouldn\u0027t hurt. instead of re-bloating every other device which uses this component. and it\u0027s never about anyone using the device or not, it\u0027s always about opinions and reviews and that\u0027s how gerrit is here.",
